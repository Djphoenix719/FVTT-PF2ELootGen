# FVTT PF2e Loot Generator
A loot generator/utility for the PF2e system in Foundry VTT. May eventually become system agnostic, but for now it only works with PF2e.

# Features
This module was originally part of *PF2e Toolbox*, however it is now separate for ease of maintainability. Below are its features, new features are in bold.

- **Roll a group of tables using a weighted table distribution**
- Quickly roll a single table and add the item to a loot sheet
- **Quickly roll higher quantities of a single, using control or shift, adjustable in the settings**
- Respects PF2e Toolbox's quicky mystification (holding alt mystifies items).
- **Roll a highly configurable spell roll and create a wand or scroll from it**
- Create weapons, armor, **and shields** with the item creator
  - Calculates all relevant statistics for the item, such as hp, hardness, price, level, etc...
  - **Drop a template to quickly set the creator to settings matching the template**
